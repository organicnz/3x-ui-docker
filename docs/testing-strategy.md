# 3x-ui VPN Testing Strategy

This document outlines our comprehensive testing strategy for the 3x-ui VPN service to ensure reliability, security, and performance.

## Testing Levels

Our testing approach incorporates multiple levels to ensure comprehensive coverage:

### 1. Unit Testing

Basic validation of individual components:
- Docker Compose file syntax and structure
- Docker image verification
- Environment variable validation

### 2. Integration Testing

Testing how components work together:
- Docker container startup and initialization
- Service endpoint accessibility
- Configuration loading

### 3. Security Testing

Examining the service for security vulnerabilities:
- Port exposure verification
- Volume mount security checks
- Privileged mode detection
- Certificate generation and validation

### 4. End-to-End Testing

Validating the complete deployment process:
- Full container deployment
- Service access verification
- Health check validation

## Automated Testing in CI/CD Pipeline

Our GitHub Actions workflow integrates testing in the CI/CD pipeline through a dedicated test job that runs before deployment:

1. **Validation Phase**: Basic verification of configuration files
2. **Testing Phase**: Comprehensive tests of Docker image and configuration
3. **Deployment Phase**: Only proceeds if tests pass

## Test Components

### GitHub Actions Workflow Test Job

The test job in our workflow:
- Verifies Docker image integrity
- Tests Docker Compose configuration
- Performs security checks
- Runs a simulated deployment
- Archives test results as artifacts

### Local Testing Script

The `scripts/test-service.sh` script provides a comprehensive local testing solution:
- Dependency verification
- Docker Compose validation
- Docker image integrity checks
- Security testing
- Container startup and service testing

## Running Tests Locally

To run tests locally:

```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
./scripts/test-service.sh

# Run GitHub Actions workflow tests locally (requires act)
act -j test
```

## Security-Focused Testing

Our testing emphasizes security:
- Validates certificates
- Checks for privilege escalation paths
- Verifies proper volume mounts
- Ensures no sensitive ports are exposed
- Tests container isolation

## Test Results and Artifacts

Test results are:
- Stored as GitHub Actions artifacts for review
- Available in CI/CD logs
- Output to console for local testing

## Continuous Improvement

We continuously improve our testing approach by:
- Reviewing test failures to identify new test cases
- Updating tests as new features are added
- Refining security checks based on emerging threats
- Automating more aspects of testing

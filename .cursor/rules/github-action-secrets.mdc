# Cursor IDE Repository Secrets Management Rules

## General Rules
1. All repository secrets must be properly encrypted and stored using GitHub's secrets management system.
2. Secrets should follow a consistent naming convention using uppercase letters and underscores.
3. Regular audits of secrets should be performed to ensure they remain current and secure.

## Access Control
1. Only authorized team members should have access to modify repository secrets.
2. Use repository environment protection rules to limit which branches can access deployment secrets.
3. Implement different access levels for development, staging, and production environments.

### Authentication
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JSON Web Token signing
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`, `SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS`: SSH authentication credentials

### Deployment
- `DEPLOY_PATH`, `SERVER_HOST`, `SERVER_USER`, `NODE_ENV`: Deployment configuration
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`: Public-facing URLs

### External Services
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: API token for Telegram bot integration
- `XUI_PANEL_URL`, `XUI_USERNAME`, `XUI_PASSWORD`: XUI panel credentials

### VPN Configuration
- `VPN_DOMAIN`, `VPN_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `XRAY_VMESS_AEAD_FORCED`: VPN service configuration

## Best Practices
1. Rotate secrets regularly, especially after team member departures.
2. Update `NODE_ENV` appropriately for different deployment environments.
3. Never hard-code secrets in application code or commit them to version control.
4. Use environment-specific secrets for multi-environment deployments.
5. Monitor secret usage and implement alerts for unusual access patterns.

## Secret Rotation Schedule
1. High-sensitivity secrets (JWT, database credentials): Every 30 days
2. Service credentials (API tokens, SSH keys): Every 90 days
3. Configuration values (URLs, environment variables): Review quarterly

## Documentation
1. Maintain documentation of all secrets, their purpose, and which systems/services they relate to via Readme.md.
2. Document the process for rotating and updating secrets.
3. Keep a record of secret update history.
